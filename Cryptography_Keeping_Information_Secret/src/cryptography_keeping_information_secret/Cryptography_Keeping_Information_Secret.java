/**
 *
 * @author Lartsev
 * 
 * In this module, we will learn about the basics of cryptography, the science of 
 * keeping information private and secure. You will learn about simpler cryptographic 
 * systems, which were used from the Roman Empire through the early 1900s. 
 * You will learn how to implement these ciphers, as well as how to break them. 
 * To solve these problems, you will work more with processing Strings, but also 
 * learn about arraysâ€”a way to store an indexable sequence of elements. 
 * You will be able to: 
 * (1) combine Strings using concatenation; 
 * (2) build Strings within a Java program using StringBuilder; 
 * (3) use arrays to store and manipulate collections of data; 
 * (4) refactor your programs for improved organization using object-oriented principles;
 * (5) and practice effective algorithm design.
