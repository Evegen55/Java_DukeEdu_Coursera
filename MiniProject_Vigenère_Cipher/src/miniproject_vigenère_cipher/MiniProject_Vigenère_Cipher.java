 * @author Lartsev
 * 
 * In this module, you will develop a program to break the Vigenère Cipher, 
 * a more complex version of the Caesar Cipher. You will improve your program 
 * in three stages: first decrypting messages where you know the language and key length,
 * then adding the capability to handle messages with unknown key length, 
 * then extending the program to handle messages in a range of possible languages. 
 * Through this project, you will be able 
 * (1) to effectively use HashSet and HashMap, 
 * (2) to expand an algorithm from solving a simpler problem to handle broader, 
 *     more complex problems, and 
 * (3) to design and modify program code involving a more complex collection 
 *     of classes, methods, and data.
